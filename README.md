In the GRAMMAR-MENTOR Project, there are 3 functions.

1. Next word prediction:- in this function, the code predicts the next word if you type "pizza" in the search box and click on predict it will give us "pizza crust".
2. Word correction:-  in this function, the code predicts whether the word is correct or not. If you type the wrong word "aed" in the search box and click on predict it will give us "and".
3. Text summarization:-  in this function, the code predicts the large text articles or stories in the short form to see what the main object is in the articles and stories.

in this project, we use Flask, jsonify, transformers, spacy, string, re, pickle, TensorFlow, and Keras.
